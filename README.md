Swagger Codegens for the Riot Games API

Here's some of the codegens for the Riot Games API generated by the https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen swagger codegen via the swaggerspecs located at http://www.mingweisamuel.com/riotapi-schema/tool/

Each branch has a different language's codegen. There's auto generated docs for every language created by the codegen.
